# GPU Optimization Insights & Learnings

## Performance Analysis

After extensive benchmarking and optimization attempts, here's what we learned:

### What We Tried

1. **GPU-native rasterization** (rasterizer_gpu.py)
   - Pure torch polygon filling
   - Result: **SLOWER** than PIL (too much kernel launch overhead)

2. **Batch parallel candidate evaluation**
   - Evaluate 200 shapes in parallel
   - Result: Minimal improvement (candidates are independent, no parallelism benefit)

3. **Batch mutation evaluation**
   - Evaluate multiple mutations simultaneously
   - Result: **SLOWER** (mutations need iterative convergence)

4. **Mixed precision FP16**
   - Use half-precision floats
   - Result: Minimal speedup, potential quality loss

### The Core Problem

**GPU operations have high latency but high throughput.**

For this workload:
- Small shapes (average 50x50 pixels)
- Many independent operations (rasterize, compute color)
- **Kernel launch overhead dominates** actual computation time

### Why Standard GPU Mode Works Better

The `OptimizerTorch` (standard GPU) is faster than `OptimizerUltra` because:

1. **Hybrid rasterization**: PIL on CPU (no kernel overhead)
2. **Selective GPU use**: Only uses GPU for heavy math (color computation)
3. **Minimal transfers**: One transfer per shape (rasterized → GPU)
4. **No premature optimization**: Keeps simple sequential flow

### Performance Breakdown (30 shapes, RTX 3090)

```
CPU Baseline:     3.07s
Standard GPU:     2.85s  (1.08x speedup) ✅
Ultra GPU:        4.00s  (0.77x slower)  ❌
```

**Why Ultra is slower:**
- Rasterization: 0.22s (5.9%) - Good!
- Color compute: 1.50s (39.4%) - More overhead than standard
- Mutation: 2.05s (54.1%) - Same as standard, no improvement

### The Winning Strategy

**Use Standard GPU mode (`OptimizerTorch`)** with:
- Hybrid rasterization (PIL → GPU tensor)
- GPU-accelerated color computation
- GPU distance calculations
- Minimal CPU↔GPU transfers

This gives consistent 5-10% speedup with zero complexity.

## Why Can't We Get 10x+ Speedup?
